	Simple model for glutamate AMPA receptors
	=========================================

  - FIRST-ORDER KINETICS, FIT TO WHOLE-CELL RECORDINGS

    Whole-cell recorded postsynaptic currents mediated by AMPA/Kainate
    receptors (Xiang et al., J. Neurophysiol. 71: 2552-2556, 1994) were used
    to estimate the parameters of the present model; the fit was performed
    using a simplex algorithm (see Destexhe et al., J. Computational Neurosci.
    1: 195-230, 1994).

  - SHORT PULSES OF TRANSMITTER (0.3 ms, 0.5 mM)

    The simplified model was obtained from a detailed synaptic model that 
    included the release of transmitter in adjacent terminals, its lateral 
    diffusion and uptake, and its binding on postsynaptic receptors (Destexhe
    and Sejnowski, 1995).  Short pulses of transmitter with first-order
    kinetics were found to be the best fast alternative to represent the more
    detailed models.

  - ANALYTIC EXPRESSION

    The first-order model can be solved analytically, leading to a very fast
    mechanism for simulating synapses, since no differential equation must be
    solved (see references below).
