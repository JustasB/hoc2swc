Learning mechanism for column formation in the olfactory bulb
by M. Migliore, Carlo Inzirillo, Gordon M. Shepherd, 
Front. Integr. Neurosci. (2007) 1:12. doi:10.3389/neuro.07.012.2007

In the olfactory bulb, the processing units for odor discrimination
are believed to involve dendrodendritic synaptic interactions between
mitral and granule cells.  There is increasing anatomical evidence
that these cells are organized in columns, and that the columns
processing a given odor are arranged in widely distributed arrays.
Experimental evidence is lacking on the underlying learning mechanisms
for how these columns and arrays are formed.  We have used a
simplified realistic circuit model to test the hypothesis that
distributed connectivity can self-organize through an
activity-dependent dendrodendritic synaptic mechanism.  The results
point to action potentials propagating in the mitral cell lateral
dendrites as playing a critical role in this mechanism, and suggest a
novel and robust learning mechanism for the development of distributed
processing units in a cortical structure.

The traces shown in Fig.2 of the paper are produced by running
2mc-w05-w00-e2i3-int220.hoc.  However, because the simulation is quite
long, the output files are included in the distribution and read by
plasticity-disp.hoc, that also allows the display of the time course
for all dendrodendritic synapses.

After the fig 2 button is pressed and the simulations have completed,
the windows can have there axes adjusted similarly to the figures:

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui mosinit.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on the simulation file
mosinit.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:

Drag and drop the plast folder onto the mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  When the mod files are finished compiling drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.
